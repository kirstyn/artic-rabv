# Notes

Modification made to original `rabvPeru2` primer scheme: primer 40 right sequence was incorrect (sent by manufacturer), so it was replaced with `rabvPeru V1 P40right` (`CCCTCGAATGACTTGCTTTCTGA`).

- `rabvPeru2 V1 P40 right` position: **11799 to 11821**  
- `rabvPeru V1 P40 right` position: **11524 to 11547**

The modification is present in primer scheme `rabvPeru2 V1`, but the primer is still named `rabvPeru2_40_RIGHT`.
